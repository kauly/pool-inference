# Pool inference

I did this project to test inference on browser using [onnxruntime-web](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/get-started/with-javascript/web.html) with wasm as backend. I'm using a YOLOv8 model trained to detect swimming pools. The code for data pre and post process was taken from this [amazing tutorial](https://dev.to/andreygermanov/how-to-create-yolov8-based-object-detection-web-service-using-python-julia-nodejs-javascript-go-and-rust-4o8e#javascript).
